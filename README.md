# Card Game (IDATT2003 Arbeidskrav 5)

This project is a **mini-project in Java**, and a **mandatory assignment** as part of the course **IDATT2003 at NTNU**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
The program allows the user to draw a hand of cards and check various properties of the hand, such as:  
-  Sum of all the card ranks  
-  Whether the hand contains any cards of suit 'hearts' (and which ones)
-  Whether the hand contains the card 'queen of spades'
-  Whether the hand forms a flush  

The **GUI** displays the cards and includes buttons for drawing a hand and checking the hand's properties.

## ðŸ›  Technologies and Tools  
- **Java** 
- **JavaFX** (for GUI)  
- **Maven** (for project structure and build management)  
- **Git** (for version control)
