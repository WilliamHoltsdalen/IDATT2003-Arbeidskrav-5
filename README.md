# Card Game (IDATT2003 Arbeidskrav 5)

This is a **mini-project in Java**, created for a mandatory assignment that is part of the course **IDATT2003 at NTNU**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
The program allows the user to draw a hand of cards and check various properties of the hand, such as:  
-  Sum of all the card ranks  
-  Whether the hand contains any cards of suit 'hearts' (and which ones)
-  Whether the hand contains the card 'queen of spades'
-  Whether the hand forms a flush  

The **GUI** displays the cards and includes buttons for drawing a hand and checking the hand's properties.

## ðŸ›  Technologies and Tools
